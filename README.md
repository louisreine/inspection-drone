# Inspection Drone project at ENPC.

This repository holds the code associated with the inspection drone project. This department project is aimed at
creating an autonomous drone for building inspection. 

We focus here on obstacle detection during a waypoint mission. 
The associated Google Drive can be found here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pWQdOV-hi2a7xwepPXjL5-DVYdoxBjQJ?usp=sharing. It is where we store the advancement of the project. 

Our drone is based on an pixhawk 4 mini architecture with a DJI F450 frame running ardupilot : https://ardupilot.org/copter/

We use dronekit as our main mavlink envrionnement : http://dronekit.io/

For the moment we are in a testing phase, so there is not much to see in this repository
